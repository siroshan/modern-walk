# NEXT JS

## Pages

- The pages router has file-system based router.
- When a file is added to pages directory it's automatically available as a page. `
pages/contact.tsx`
- But best practice is using **Index Routes**. Create a folder with name of the route, then add an index file. `pages/about/index.tsx`
- The router supports nested files. If you create a nested folder structure, files will automatically be routed in the same way still.  
- Next.js supports pages with dynamic routes. If you create a file called `pages/products/[id].tsx`, then it will be accessible at `products/1`, `products/2`, etc. Here `id` is the dynamic segment. Dynamic segments can be accessed from `useRouter`,
- It allows single shared layout for the entire application using custom app. (e.g.: Application usually have same navigation bar and footer on every page.)
- It also allows to add layout per page as well. If you need multiple layouts, you can add a property `getLayout` to your page, allowing you to return a React component for the layout. 


## Data Fetching
- If you export a function called `getStaticProps` (Static Site Generation) from a  page, Next.js will pre-render this page at build time using the props returned by `getStaticProps`.
- Usually can be used for home page, or any other pages where user specific data is not need.
- If a page has dynamic routes and uses  `getStaticProps`, it needs to define a list of paths to be statically generated.
- When you export a function called  `getStaticPaths`  (Static Site Generation) from a page that uses dynamic routes, Next.js will statically pre-render all the paths specified by  `getStaticPaths`.
- It's useful for pre-rendering the specific products' pages for SEO purposes.
- Next.js allows you to create or update static pages _after_ youâ€™ve built your site. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) enables you to use static-generation on a per-page basis, **without needing to rebuild the entire site**. With ISR, you can retain the benefits of static while scaling to millions of pages.
- If you export  `getServerSideProps` (Server-Side Rendering) function from a page, Next.js will pre-render this page on each request using the data returned by `getServerSideProps`.

## Custom App
Next.js uses the  `App`  component to initialize pages. You can override it and control the page initialization and:

-   Persist layouts between page changes
-   Keeping state when navigating pages
-   Inject additional data into pages
-   Add global CSS 

Adding a custom `getInitialProps` in your `App` will disable Automatic Static Optimization in pages without static generation.

`App` does not support Next.js Data Fetching methods like `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`

## Custom Document
A custom `Document` can update the `<html>` and `<body>` tags used to render a Page. This file is only rendered on the server, so event handlers like `onClick` cannot be used in `_document`.

`Document` currently does not support Next.js Data Fetching methodslike `getStaticProps`or `getServerSideProps`

## Custom Server

It should only be used when the integrated router of Next.js can't meet your app requirements.

A custom server will remove important performance optimizations, like **serverless functions** and **Automatic Static Optimization**
